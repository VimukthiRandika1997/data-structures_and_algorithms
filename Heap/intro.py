'''
The heap is a tree data structure where each node is smaller than or equal
to its children if it is a min-heap or

greater than or qual to its childern if it's a max-heap, depending on the type.

Min Heap
                                    3
                    6                           4
            9               12          8               7
        14      15      13      18  11      9

- The root is the smallest element 


Max Heap

                                17
                    14                       16
            11           12         12               13
        6      5      7      2  9       11

        
- The root is the highest element

        ##-- Binary Heap --##

- The binary heap is a complete binary tree that respects the heap property

- Complete binary tree:
    
    A binary tree where every level is completely filled except maybe the last one,
    but all its nodes have to be as far to the left as possible.

- Heap property:

    Each node is smaller than or equal to its children if it's a min-heap.

    Each node is greater than or equal to its children if it's a max-heap.
